# 🏧 Simple ATM Application (Java)

## 📌 Project Overview
The ATM Simulation Program is a simple Java console-based application that allows users to perform basic banking operations such as checking balance, depositing money, and withdrawing money.

This project demonstrates the use of:
- While loops
- If-Else conditional statements
- User input handling using Scanner
- Menu-driven programming

---

## 🚀 Features
- Predefined initial balance (₹5000)
- Check account balance
- Deposit money
- Withdraw money with balance validation
- Insufficient funds handling
- Continuous menu until user exits

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Java
- java.util.Scanner

---

## 💻 How the Program Works
1. The program starts with an initial balance of ₹5000.
2. A menu is displayed with four options:
1 → Check Balance
2 → Deposit
3 → Withdraw
4 → Exit
3. The user selects an option.
4. The system processes the selected operation.
